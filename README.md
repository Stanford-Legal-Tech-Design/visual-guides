Visual Guides for Legal Help

These are open-source visuals created by Stanford Legal Design Lab.

They are meant for legal help organizations -- courts, self-help centers, legal aid groups, and other public interest groups -- to use when assisting people trying to navigate the legal system.

How to use them?
1. Look at the png and pdf versions to see if the visual is of use to the case that you want to address.
2. Use the .eps or other raw image file, to be able to adjust language and images to better fit your local rules and procedures.
3. If you need help with edits, please write to us, and hopefully we can help with your efforts.
4. Share the images you create -- we would love to see what you make, and possibly offer it to our community for them to use.
